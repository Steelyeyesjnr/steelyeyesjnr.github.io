## Summary

I am a highly motivated Aerospace Engineering student with a strong work ethic. I am skilled in project leadership, Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), and Computer-Aided Design (CAD).Through group projects at the University of Hertfordshire, I have developed a professional approach and proficiency in the full product lifecycle from design to testing. I am currently gaining an international perspective on engineering and technology while studying abroad at Yonsei University.
