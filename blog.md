 *TensorFlow, a “machine learning system that operates at large scale and in heterogeneous environments”. To put simply, TensorFlow is a system that redefined the scale on which we train and run machine learning models, indescribably more capable than its predecessors. From being able to run large clusters of data sets to running locally on a mobile phone, it’s safe to say TensorFlow was superior for its time. To get a deeper understanding of how TensorFlow performs this magic, we must go back and learn why the Google Brain team, felt like developing such a system.*
