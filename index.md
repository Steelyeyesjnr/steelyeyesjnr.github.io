## Hello!

I am currently persuing a BEng in __Aerospace Engineering with Space Technology__ at the __University of Hertfordshire__. At this time, I am studying abroad at __Yonsei University__ in South Korea, getting an insight into __Artifitial Intelligence and Machine Learning__.


## Key Areas of Expertise

* __Engineering Analysis:__ Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Analysis (FEA), and Structural Design.
* __Project Leadership:__ Managing the full product lifecycle, from concept and design (CAD/CATIA) to manufacturing and testing.
* __Interdisciplinary Focus:__ Expanding knowledge in Distributed Learning and Inference (AI).


## Outide the Lab

My approach to problem-solving and learning doesn't stop with engineering! I'm an enthusiastic reader and love digging into anything that requires strategy. I am also an avid traveler and explorer. My passion for seeing new places allows me to continually expand my global knowledge and cultural awareness. I stay physically active through sports, believing a healthy lifestyle is key.
